# SUMMARY

Hello, My name is Sanket Upadhyay. Today I'm going to tell my experience of the __MissingSkill__ sessions. As its name says __MissingSkill__ helps us to learn new skills, technologies in deep way. The entire session was recorded but it feels like I'm watching it live because of its detailed idea of every concepts. 
__MissingSkill__ increases the understaing of __Linux__, __GIT__, __Javascript__ and many more technologies. Before joining to __MissingSkill__ I had a basic knowldge of __Linux__ and __JS__ but now yes I can say I have sufficient knowldge to work with __Linux__, __JS__ and one new __GIT__.
 __GIT__ was new to me but watching __GIT tutorials__ I learnt a lot of its basic commands like: creating the repository, push-pull request, creating new branches to merging them, so nicely.

These skills will help me a lot in future and I wish to learn more from __MissingSkill__.
